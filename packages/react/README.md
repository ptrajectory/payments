### ptrajectory-mpesa-payments-ui

- Forms are hard, there's so much you could do wrong, and the last thing you need is a buggy form when trying to collect payments from your customers
- We get that, and so we descided to create an easy to use form that can take care of how ou collect the mpesa information details from your customers.
- This form has inbuilt validation and great accessibility. Hope we made your dev experience a little easier :)
